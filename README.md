# NodeCG Basic React

This is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle with basic functionality for using React.
Once you get NodeCG version `^1.0.0` up and running, you are good to go.

## Install and Use

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn build`

Once you are happy with how your overlay is looking, `yarn bundle` will minify and make everything production ready
